# IDS 705: Principles of Machine Learning

Archive of course work and material - Professor Kyle Bradbury from Duke University

assignments for IDS 705 - Principles of Machine Learning taken at Duke in partial fulfillment of my MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science degree topics covered in each assignment are indicated in each individual read me file

for this course, assignments were largely "choose your own path". i often decided the problem i would create an answer for and turn in for credit, so specific topics are indicative of my interests and other research work. specifically, see my individual research methods shown in Assignment 1 and Assignment 3.
